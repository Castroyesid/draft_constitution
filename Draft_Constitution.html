                        <li>(b) A withdrawal referendum shall be initiated by petition of at least 25% of the registered citizens of the withdrawing jurisdiction, or by a resolution of the Indigenous Nation's governing body through its own processes.</li>
                        <li>(c) Upon receipt of a valid petition or resolution, a withdrawal referendum shall be held within the withdrawing jurisdiction no sooner than 6 months and no later than 12 months after the petition is validated. This waiting period ensures deliberation and cannot be waived.</li>
                        <li>(d) Withdrawal requires approval by a three-fourths majority of registered citizens in the withdrawing jurisdiction who cast a vote, with a minimum participation rate of 80% of registered citizens.</li>
                        <li>(e) If a withdrawal referendum fails to achieve the required threshold, a new withdrawal petition for the same jurisdiction may not be submitted for at least 5 years.</li>

                                <li>(i) Joint ownership of land within the withdrawing Nation's recognized territorial claims shall be restructured. The withdrawing Nation's ownership interest shall be redistributed among the remaining Indigenous Nations with recognized overlapping or adjacent claims to that territory, as determined by those Nations through their own processes. Where no other Indigenous Nation holds recognized claims, the ownership interest shall be held in trust by the Federal government until such claims are established or until the withdrawing Nation rejoins the union;</li>
                                <li>(ii) Guardianship of any Protected Natural Entities assigned to the withdrawing Nation under Article VI shall be reassigned to other appropriate Indigenous Nations with connections to the entity, or to Regional or Federal guardianship as prescribed in Article VI, Section 2(d);</li>
                                <li>(iii) The withdrawing Nation's share of revenue from land leases and resource activities under Article XI, Section 11(c) shall be redistributed among the remaining Indigenous Nations with recognized claims to the relevant territory, or held in the Federal Treasury if no such Nations exist;</li>
                                <li>(iv) Citizens registered with the withdrawing Indigenous Nation shall have the same rights and transition period prescribed in subsection (f)(iii) of this Section;</li>

                                <li>(vi) Withdrawal by an Indigenous Nation does not extinguish that Nation's historical and ancestral connection to its territories. If the Nation subsequently rejoins the union under Article XIX, its territorial claims shall be restored to the extent they have not been superseded by new claims recognized during the period of withdrawal.</li>

                                <li>(i) Specific to identified measures, categories, or policy areas, and not a blanket transfer of voting authority;</li>

                                <li>(iii) Shall not affect the separate vote of the Indigenous Nation itself under Section 6 of this Article, which remains a collective decision of the Nation as a whole.</li>
