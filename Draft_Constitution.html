                        <li>(a) Cultural and political communities that identify as Latter Nations may organize and seek recognition as parties to this constitution through Federal Vote;</li>
                        <li>(b) A petition for recognition as a Latter Nation must demonstrate a defined cultural or historical identity as a distinct people, an organized governance structure capable of participating in Federal processes, and such other criteria as may be prescribed by law;</li>
                        <li>(c) The criteria and processes for Latter Nations recognition may be further refined by law enacted through Federal Vote;</li>
                        <li>(d) Once recognized, Latter Nations have the same voting rights and responsibilities as First Nations under this Constitution;</li>
                        <li>(e) Recognition as a Latter Nation does not automatically confer territorial rights. Latter Nations seeking territorial claims to specific lands must demonstrate documented connection through continuous presence, cultural practices, and stewardship, and obtain recognition from the First Nations with existing claims to those lands;</li>
                        <li>(f) Territorial claim petitions that are denied may not be resubmitted for the same territory for at least 2 years;</li>
                        <li>(g) Territorial claims may be recognized incrementally for different portions of claimed territory as agreements are reached with different First Nations.</li>

                <h2>NOTES FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                
                <p>This Constitution addresses the core structural elements of governance but intentionally leaves certain implementation details to be determined through democratic processes. The following areas merit continued attention and development:</p>
                
                <h3>Implementation Challenges:</h3>

                <p>These matters are intentionally left open for determination through Federal Vote:</p>
